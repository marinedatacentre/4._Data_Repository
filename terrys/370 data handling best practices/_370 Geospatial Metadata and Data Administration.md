**Purpose:**

This document is a step-by-step guide explaining how an individual can perform tasks such as entering metadata as xml and as mef, checking the validity of the loaded metadata, adding optional extras such as thumbnails and hyperlinks.

There are other administration features only performed by a central administrator, such as creating and changing metadata groups, creating identifying logos, changing the name of the server, changing contact emails and creating and assigning privileges to users.

The general description is thoroughly described in the GeoNetwork Users Manual (<http://geonetwork-opensource.org/manuals/2.10.3/eng/users/GeoNetworkUserManual.pdf> ) at time of writing ).
